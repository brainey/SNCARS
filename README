Santa Clara Amateur Radio Service
SNCARS

This is a application to manage and host content for
members of the City of Santa Clara's ARES/RACES group.

See http://www.santaclara-ares.org for more info on
the group.

The goal of this project is to develope a collection of
services that provide member management (in a secure way),
member forums (forum may be opened to registered guests),
event and project information, reference material, tie
in with social media sites such as Facebook, LinkedIn,
Flickr and Twitter.

The member management will need to do the following:
the member data such name, callsign, frn, optional link to
fcc page for their license, qrz link to their page if they
have one, a copy of their application if available, their
training, event and net participation records. So of these
records (such as their application and such) need to be
visible only to the member and the EC / designated AEC,
to view. Other information would be visible to all members.
Little if no data would be visible to the non members (will
have to figure out how the concept of a forum with registered
"guests" (non-members) works with the members - some how I guess
I would need to make everybody look the same and make it hard
for non members to see the difference between a non-member
and a member. On the other hand it is probably important for
a member to know the difference. Some thought will have to
go into this.

First Goals:
 o management of member data
   o name
   o role
   o callsign
   o license level
   o contact info
      o home address
      o optional work address / employeer

      o sms via email
      o other ims - aol, yahoo!, goggle talk, skype
      o social - facebook, twitter, linkedin, etc.
      o regular notice (i.e. weekly roster) preferred account

  o net control interface
    o presented with list of member, in groups by callsign suffix
    o easy interface that has the net control type the letters of the
      as heard - try to match the group in first but sets up for entry
      to one of the other groups or even new visitor
    o maintains running count per group and total
    o support a second count (for instance for the breakfast count
      or maybe solicit for who plans to attend a meeting)
    o has stratch area for recording who has volunteered to aide in
      the count, wished to make an announcement, make contact after
      the net, etc
    o has prompts for the script
      o is adaptable for added things like the ICS 213 message at the
        beginning of the month or reminders for breakfast or upcoming meeting
o generate reports for city and county
  o send city emergency manager our stats
  o send county requested information
o manage paper work generated by events and drills - archieve, accessible and
  maybe searchable (that would be nice)

    o would be nice if we could front for the county event page,
       providing a one stop shop for ham events in the count
o social
  o forums
  o gallery
  o member "home pages" 
  o don't know how far to go do this path - would hate to replicate
    what so many other web sites do well

o data base
  o where to keep, archive, protect member data and any other data
    generated from the site (forums, galleries, home pages, etc)

o site recovery
  o process by which site is restored after some failure from some
    archive

o mailing list support
  o need to maintain mailing list for entire membership, the board and
    possibly per call tree

o interface to send page via hopefully working paging system

o call tree maintenance / generation

o control of K6SNC linking ?

o access to SCEWN


By the way, this project will replace the current static

web page at http://www.santaclara-ares.org.
